I covered an old brew project and its possible future in my last post.  In the same vein, this post covers my CNC machine conversions, including a future project.

My first venture into CNC machining was in 1994 as a high school senior in an engineering program, using a then state-of-the art system, integrating AutoCAD with a rudimentary CAM suite on a pretty beefy Bridgeport style machine.  It piqued my interest in a big way, but when the course was over, my machine shop adventures took a decade-plus hiatus.

Sometime in 2006 I found [Chris Krstanovic's webpage](http://cnc.novalab.org) detailing his hobby CNC conversion of a Smithy 1220LTD combination lathe/mill.  I bought the same model Smithy and did several manual lathe projects with it, but I was sorely disappointed with it's poor capacity for milling and ultimately sold the Smithy before CNC'ing it.

A few years later, I discovered Daniel "Hoss" Kemp's [YouTube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/hossmachine) and [homepage](http://hossmachine.info).  He was just finishing up his very elaborate Sieg X2 mill conversion at the time.  Hoss is a mainstay at the [CNC Zone Forum](http://www.cnczone.com) and has shared a *ton* of great info on hobby CNC machine conversions and projects.
