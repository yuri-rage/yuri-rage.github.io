I just set up my GitHub account and wondered if I could use it for web hosting.  It turns out that not only can I host webpages on GitHub, but there is native Jekyll support.  That means that I have an opportunity to learn a bit about web design in the 21st century (I haven't hand written an HTML doc yet!), and pick up some Ruby along the way.  Git is a slick way to manage the site, as it provides innate version control and backup.  Jekyll manages the dirty work of building a coherent, well formatted presentation.  And most everything I do can be manipulated via the command line on a \*nix machine (I'm typing this in vim).  

The repository for this site is located at <https://github.com/yuri-rage/yuri-rage.github.io>.  I've already edited the Rakefile to more easily manage git commits and pushes.

Thanks to <http://jekyllbootstrap.com> for providing a very complete, almost turnkey site.  More to follow (albeit, probably slowly)!
