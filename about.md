This is my first blog.  I'm usually an early adopter, but blogging just never struck a chord with me.  So, I'm roughly a decade or two late to the party.  I wanted a place to develop a few projects, so I created a GitHub account.  As I learned about GitHub, I discovered GitHub Pages and thought perhaps I'd chronicle my projects along the way...enter this blog.

I enjoy all things DIY - homebrewing beer, cooking, electronics and software, welding, CNC machines, cars/motorcycles - you name it.  Hopefully I can keep this blog updated with the latest tinkering from my office and garage alike.
